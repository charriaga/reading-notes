### What is This Web Page for?

This web page contains all my notes on the courses I take at Code Fellows. Organized throughout will be an organized wiki of what I've learned.

## Growth Mindset

**It is important to maintain a growth mindset throughout my learning journey.**

### Definition

According to Atlassian blog post ["How you can benefit from a growth mindset"](https://www.atlassian.com/blog/inside-atlassian/growth-mindset) by Steve Haffenden:
>"A growth mindset believes that oneâ€™s fundamental abilities can be developed through perseverance and effort; intelligence and talent are simply good starting points. A growth mindset is synonymous with a love of learning."

That is to say, a growth mindset is the internalization of the belief that intelligence is not stagnant nor innate, but something which can be developed and grown over time through development, practice, and a dedication to life long learning. 

### Reminders

This mindset can be difficult to maintain in today's society, especially when concepts like innate and genetic talent are so prevalent. But through a consistent implementation of a few habits and reminders, I can do my best to stay within its boundaries.

- **No Pain, No Gain;** learning takes effort and tenacity.
- **Always Return to Obstacles;** if something feels overwhelming and un-do-able, walk away and take a break. But always return to give it another go or try a different angle.
- **Mistakes are Happy Accidents;** turn failure and mistakes into happy little trees by viewing them as learning experiences.
