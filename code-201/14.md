# CSS Transformations and Animations

## CSS Transform Property

The CSS3 transform property acts in a similar way to the transform tool used in art and drawing programs. It operates both in a two-dimensional and three-dimensional capacity, utilizing the x and y axis for 2D transformations and the z axis for 3D transformations.

Some of the things it can do is **rotate**, **scale**, and **skew**. It can also work with perspective and depth on a 3D basis.
