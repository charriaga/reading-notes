# Canvas and Chart.js

## Canvas

`canvas` is a newer HTML5 tag that lets developers draw graphics via JavaScript.

It requires a `width` and `height` attribute as well as a closing tag. The content between an opening tag and cloding tag is fallback content.

### In JavaScript

To render something in `canvas`, the `getContext()` method is used. It takes one argument, the type of context it's rendering, and allows the developer to then create a graphic.

## Chart.js

Chart.js is currently GitHub's most popular chart library for JavaScript. It provides a number of chart types and sets and utilizes the `canvas` element.

Chat.js can be installed with npm and then referenced via the `script` tag in you HTML file.

### Types of Charts

Chart.js has many types of charts, including:

+ Bar Chart
+ Area Chart
+ Bubble Chart
+ Doughnut and Pie Charts
+ Line Chart
+ Mixed Charts
+ Polar Area Charts
+ Radar Chart
+ Scatter Chart

### Chart Benefits

Charts are more visually appealing than tables and communicate data much easier. They have the benefit of increasing a site's readability and condensing a large amount of information into a smaller, more accessible visual.
