Syntax highlighting is the color coding of different syntax's of code in order to help the writer easily determine what they are looking at. This is essential to a good text editor because it vastly improves readability.

Extensions improve the versatility of a text editor and also the ease and speed of use. By having a large selection of extensions available, the text editor can become much more versatile.
