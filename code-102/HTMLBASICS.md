# HTML Basics

## What is HTML

HTML stands for "HyperText Markup Language". It is the structural foundation to the anatomy of a website's content.

## Elements

The basic building block on HTML is an **element.** Elements are used to encapsulate content in different sections that act in certain ways. There are many different types of elements, each of which interacts with content differently.

### Anatomy

There are 3 main parts to an element's anatomy:

- The **opening tag:** The name of the element wrapped in angle brackets. For example, `<p>` is the opening tag to the paragraph element.

- The **content:** The content of the element, or what you want to be on your website. It is placed between the opening and closing tags.

- The **closing tag:** Similar to an opening tag, the closing tag shows where the element ends. It has a forward slash and the name of the element wrapped in angle brackets. For example, `</p>` is the closing tag to the paragraph element.

### Attributes

An attribute is extra information added to an element. It's placed in the opening tag after the element name and between the angle brackets. Many attributes have **values**, which add more information to the attribut itself.

Attributes with values are followed by an equals sign and then is wrapped in quotation marks.

For example, in the case of `<p class="note">`, "class" is the attribute and "note" is the class.

### Semantic Elements

**Semantics** in code refers to the purpose or meaning of a piece of code. While one can write HTML code to mimic the purpose of an element, such as creating a large body of relatively small text without using the `p` element, there are elements with semantic value.

For example, `<h1></h1>` is used to create a top level heading. It also serves to tell things like search engines and other codings that the content inside of it is to be considered as such. The extra information is useful to serving the content's purpose.

**It is good practice to utilize semantic elements for this reason.**
