## Version Control

A **Version Control System** is a type of system which is used to organize, maintain, and revisit varient versions of code. This can allow you to revert a file to previous versions and compare changes made over time to code.

There are various types of version control.

- **Local Version Control** aka Local Version Control System (Local VCS). One database on a hard drive that stores versions to a file.

- **Centralized Version Control** aka Centralized Version Control System (CVCS). A database of all file versions saved to a server with multiple clients. This allows for smoother collaboration. However if the server fails, the system fails.

- **Distributed Version Control** aka Distributed Version Control System (DVCS). DVCS makes up for the system failure vulnerability of CVCS by allowing clients to create mirrors of repositories which can replace any data lost in an instance of server failure.
