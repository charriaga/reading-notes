# JavaScript Operators and Loops

## Expressions

An **expression** is a block of code that results in the creation of a **value**. There are two types of expressions, ones that merely evaluate and do nothing with the value created and ones that do something with the value, such as assigning it.

## Operators

An operator is used for many different things, including assigning or comparing values, or performing arithmatic.

Examples of operators are `=`, `+`, and `||`

## Loops

A loop is a block of code set to repeat itself until a certain condition is met. It allows easy repition while maintaining clean and precise code.

Loops are used to do repeat tasks.

There are many different types of loops.

### For Statement

A `for` loop is a type of loop that repeats itself until a specified condition resolves to false.

#### Syntax

A `for` loop is written as:

`for (initialization; condition; afterthought){Statement}`

The **Intitialization** is the start expression of the code, and is the first piece of code executed.

The **Condition** is an expression that can be evaluated as true or false. If the output of the code resolves to true, the code will repeat itself again.

The **Afterthought** is the update to the code that is executed with every loop.

### While Statement

A `while` loop is a type of loop that repeats itself until a specified condition resolves to true.

#### Syntax

A `while` loop is written as:

`while (condition){Statement}`

The **Condition** is an expression that evaluates to true or false. While the statement resolves to true, the Statement code is implemented. Once the statememnt resolves to false, the Statement code stops implementing.
