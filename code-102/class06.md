# Javascript Basics

## What is Javascript?

Javascript is a front end and back end coding language used primarily to create a dynamic and interactive experience in websites. It is the backbone of how web pages work.

## Variables

One of Javascript's main components are **variables**. Variables are containers of data created by the progranmmer.

### Declaring a Variable

Variables are "declared", or created, via four different commands.

#### const

`const` is the command to create a variable with a constant, unchanging value. Once the value of a `const` variable is declared, it cannot be changed.

#### let

`let` is the command to create a variable with a changeable value. After its value is assigned, it can be changed and infinite number of times.

#### var

`var` is an outdated way of declaring a variable. It was used before `const` and `let` were developed. It's only purpose now is to be utilized in older browsers.

#### (none)

`(none)` is another outdated command to declare a variable. It should be used only in very specific circumstances.

### Assignment Operators

**Assignment operators** are operators that assign data, or a "value" to a declared variable. The basic assignment operator is `=`.

## Input and Output

One of the main backbones of javascript is the input and output of data. Data can be outputted via different commands including `console.log`, `document.write`, among others. Data can be received via the code itself, the programmer, or the user interacting with a webpage. Data received from a user is called **user input**.
