# Javascript Functions

## Definition

A JavaScript function is a container for a collection of code made to complete a specific task. Invoking the function name instead of rewriting the same section of code over and over saves time and energy.

### Invoking

Also known as "calling", **invoking** a function is the term for summoning it. By writing the function name, it tells the program reading the code to find the block of code that the function represents and implement it.

## Control Flow

**Control flow** is the order by which code is read and implemented. While typically in JavaScript, code is read top to bottom, the utilization of function interrupts that flow. The computer reading the script must skip to a function's code location everytime it is invoked, this alters the control flow.

## Syntax

A function is written by its name, followed immediately after by a parenthesis.

For Example:

`myFunction()`

The `()` operator utilized here is what actively executes the function. Parameters for the function can be written inside the parenthesis when it is executed and they will be properly implemented within the function's code.
