# Markdown
## Definition
Markdown is one of the world's most widely used markup languages. It allows the use of visual edits of sentences and words without the use of a WYSIWYG editor.
### Usefulness
Markdown is used as a means of portraying information in a quick, easy, and visually digestable way. It is platform-independent - therefore, markdown files can be transferred easily between applications, editors, and websites. And it is able to transcend the life expectancy of software programs that may use or host markdown files, making it future-proof.
## Syntax
### Headings
There are 6 levels of heading in Markdown. Adding one `#` with a space in front of it before the desired heading text creates the largest heading, and adding `######` with a space in front of it before the desired heading text creates the smallest heading.

**Examples:**
# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
#### Heading 4
##### Heading 5
###### Heading 6

### Bold
To make text **Bold**, ecapsulate the desired text in `**` on each side.

**Example:**

`**Bold Text**` = **Bold Text**

### Italicized
To make text *Italicized*, Ecapsulate it in either `_` or `*` on either side.

**Example:**

`_Italicized Text_` and `*Italicized Text*` = *Italicized Text*

### Create a Link

To add a link to text use `[Desired Text](link url)`

**Example:**

`Here is a link to [my GitHub Profile](https://github.com/charriaga)` = Here is a link to [my GitHub Profile](https://github.com/charriaga)

### Bullet Point List

There are three ways to make an unordered list, either by adding a `-`, `*`, or `+` before on each bulleted point.

**Example:**

```
- fish
* bread
+ Chips
```
=
- fish
* bread
+ chips
