# JavaScript Call Stack amd Debugging

A call is the instance of function invocation. As such, a Call Stack is a stack of function invocations. In a call stack, the last one pushed into the stack is the first out pushed out and vice versa, this is called LIFO (Last In, First Out).

Calls happen one at a time. In the instance of too many functions being called, stack overflow can happen, which will cause an error in the code.

## JavaScript Error Messages

There are many types of JavaScript errors.

- **Reference Error**: A variable has not been declared, or has been declared after it is invoked.
- **Syntax Error**: An error in the syntax, aka something cannot be executed in terms of syntax.
- **Range Error**: An object is given an invalid length.
- **Type Error**: The type of object or primitive cannot be used in the way attempted. (i.e. using map() on an object or parse() on an array).

### Breakpoints

A breakpoint is a placed point in code that forces the code to stop running at a certain line. It's used for debugging purposes.

### Debugger

The `debugger` statement allows you to view a code's run history before stopping. It acts similar to the history tool in lots of digital art programs.
