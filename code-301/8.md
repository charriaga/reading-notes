# API Best Practices

API stands for Application Programming Interface.

## REST

AKA **Respresentational State Transfer**

REST is an architectural style for making networking applications. An architectural style is a collection of principles and guidelines dictating how an application should be implemented.

REST API's are designed around a resource.

Resources have identifiers, which are unique URIs (aka **Uniform Resource Identifier**) that the resource uses.

REST API's that use HTTP use standard HTTP verbs, most common of which are GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE.

### Maturity Model for web API's

proposed by Leonard Richardson in 2008.

- Level 0: Define one URI, and all operations are POST requests to this URI.
- Level 1: Create separate URIs for individual resources.
- Level 2: Use HTTP methods to define operations on resources.
- Level 3: Use hypermedia.

Most API's are around level 2.

### API Design

#### URI's

A good URI should be based off of nouns and not verbs.

For Example:

**Good:** `https://studio.com/orders`

**Bad:** `https://studio.com/make-orders`

#### Resources

A single resource can have multiple tasks. It should not mirror the internal database or delve into the minutae.

An API that has many smaller resources is known as a "chatty API". It can create a larger load on the server and should be avoided.

### HTTP Status Codes

- **GET:** Successful: 200. Successful but no content: 204. Unsuccessful: 404 (Not Found).

- **POST:** Successful: 200. Successful but no return: 204. Unsuccessful: 400 (Bad Request).

- **PUT:** Successful: 201, 200, 204. Unsuccessful: 409 (Conflict).

- **PATCH:** Unsuccessful: 415 (Unsupported Media Type), 400 (Bad Request), 409 (Confilct).

- **Delete:** Successful: 204. Doesn't exist: 404 (Not Found).
